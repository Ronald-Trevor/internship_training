# internship_training
This repository is for my internship training dealing with machine learning
I will use various datasets that i will be guided on by my supervisor to help me master any necessary skills i need 
to master machine learning critically and effectively
the main language i will be using will be python however at later stages i may jump into R programming language
because it was recommended by my supervisor 
thank you
The notebook named titanic dataset using LogisticRegression is used to make predictions on the survivors of the titanic victims using various features of the passengers. I used LogisticRegression because its one of the simplest algorithms for beginners to master before going into the complex details of machine learning
The notebook named predicting prices of houses in melborune city was a followup learning procedure from kaggle where they taught how make predictions on the prices of houses in melbourne City using Decision Trees
Then the followup for Random Forests as a patchup for over fitting and under fitting which is the main weakness of Decision Trees in order to minimize the errors in our predictions
