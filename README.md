# internship_training
This repository is for my internship training dealing with machine learning
I will use various datasets that i will be guided on by my supervisor to help me master any necessary skills i need 
to master machine learning critically and effectively
the main language i will be using will be python however at later stages i may jump into R programming language
because it was recommended by my supervisor 
thank you
